>
  NLP project in which I created a model that converts text snippets into vectors and returns similarity percentage between the two texts using BERT and Cosine Similarity. I also made an API for this model using fast API and hosted it on the Heroku cloud platform.

  bg="linear-gradient(to right, #D585FF 0%, #00FFEE 100%)"
>
  I gathered sales and stock information for Tesla and GameStop and used Python to show the data. I used 'beautiful soup' to scrape the two stocks' quarterly earnings from a financial website and yfinance to get financial information for Tesla and Gamestop using the 'yticker' API call. I analyzed both datasets using line charts to visualize them.
